# Title
Image classification of MNIST dataset in Tensorflow: A hands-on guide

## Project Overview
How to train neuronal networks (NN) for image classification in Tensorflow (Python)

This project is a hands-on guide with the practical steps required
to train neuronal networks for image classification using Tensorflow. With this
projet you will learn:

- How to build NN in Tensorflow.
- How to train NN.
- How to parametrize and tune the main parameters used in NN training.
- How to evaluate NN performance.

The main file of this project is an Ipython notebook (Analysis.ipynb) 
with detailed explanation of the steps carried out in the training/testing
phases. Please refer to that file for further explanation.

## Installation and Setup
- Python 3.10.12
- Pandas 2.1.0
- Numpy 1.26.4
- Matplotlib 3.6.0
- Sklearn 1.4.2

## Data Source
This project contains two data sources, one dataset used for training and 
one dataset used for testing. Both can be found in the following

## Code structure
This project is made of two main packages:
- Analysis.ipynb => Ipython notebook containing the main part of the project.
- Utils.py => Auxiliary package containing functions called by Analysis.ipynb.
